#### Introduction
This repo includes the source codes and pretrained models for our latest work on isointense infant brain segmentation. The two major components are 1) disentangled cycle-consistent adversarial network (DCAN) for style transfer between isointense and adult-like phase images; 2) the segmentation network coseg that implmentes multi-view learning to incorporate adult-like phase images in isointense infant brain segmentation. If you find this repo useful, please give it a star ‚≠ê and consider citing our paper in your research. Thank you.
