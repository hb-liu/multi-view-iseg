#### Introduction
This repo includes the source codes and pretrained models for our latest work on isointense infant brain segmentation. The two major components are 1) disentangled cycle-consistent adversarial network (DCAN) for style transfer between isointense and adult-like phase images; 2) the segmentation network coseg that implmentes multi-view learning to incorporate adult-like phase images in isointense infant brain segmentation. If you find this repo useful, please give it a star ‚≠ê and consider citing our paper in your research. Thank you.

## 1. Create Environment:
- Python 3 (Recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download))

- NVIDIA GPU + [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org)

- Python packages:

```shell
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Prepare Code, Dataset, and Pretained Models:
Build up the workspace, so that everything can be stored correctly:
```shell
  sh install.sh
```

Format each data as:
```shell
|--<name_of_the_data>
    |-- t1.nii.gz
    |-- t2.nii.gz
    |-- seg.nii.gz
```

Put data into the correct folders:
- for isointense phase images, put them into <pwd>/dcan/data/raw/6m
- for adult-like phase images, put them into <pwd>/dcan/data/raw/12m
Suppose <pwd> is the directory of this repo
